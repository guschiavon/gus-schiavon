      <p>We created easy-to-use templates with WYSIWYG editing on CloudCannon CMS: forget calling the developer (me, in this case!) every time you want to update your business hours! With the new template, clients can even <strong>build new pages themselves</strong>.</p>

Jake and Jaz are the brains and heart behind [Innate Creative](https://innatecreative.co), a web services agency from Gold Coast in Australia. With the focus on the healthcare industry, their main clients are chiropractors but they also cater to dentists and physicians. They have requested the development of reusable Jekyll templates for deployment via [CloudCannon CMS](https://cloudcannon.com). Together we have created **2 modular templates** which allow for easy and quick deployment of a live site: **responsive utility classes** and a **page-builder feature** makes creating a new website for their clients extremely fast.
