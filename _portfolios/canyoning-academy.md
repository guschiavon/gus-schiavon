As a co-founder of [V7 Academy](https://v7academy.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an online canyoning training course organisation, I was assigned the role to **develop the visual identity and web resources** for the business. The "V7" in the name represents the hardest, most technical level of an international canyoning rating system, and the website should represent this too. We have worked on a static site with **multiple layouts** to showcase the courses and levels, and linked the Sign-up/Sign-in actions directly with the LearnWorlds platform. The goal for the website was simple: to take over the canyoning training courses search term and turn V7 Academy into the reference for modern canyoning learning. The [V7 Basecamp blog](https://v7academy.com/basecamp){:target="_blank}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} combines the speed of Jekyll static sites with responsive image generation, and with dedicated, optimized content we have achieved high-speed-performance and excellent SEO results: **every blog page organically ranks as #1 on Google searches** for its keyword/keyphrase searches.
