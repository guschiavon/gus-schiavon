Hannah and [The Style Lounge](https://thestyleloungelichfield.co.uk){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} team had requested an overhaul of their WordPress website: **fresh design, intuitive eCommerce integration and easy content updates** were a requirement that their WP site wasn't delivering. We agreed on the development of a **completely new** website and Shopify integration, bringing their business presentation to a whole new level.

The resulting site is super performant and easy to use with the [CloudCannon CMS](https://cloudcannon.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"}; the inventory is managed through the Shopify app and made available through [The Style Lounge shop](https://shop.thestyleloungelichfield.co.uk){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} and Facebook/Instagram channels, allowing Hannah and the team to easily sell online.
