testimonial: Being a studio specialised in motion graphics, we wanted to add some dynamism to our site. Gus helped us <strong>implement the scroll animations just as requested</strong> and more importantly, on schedule! We'll be upgrading our site with more features soon, and Gus will be <strong>the</strong> man to handle that!

      <p>What's not to love about <a href="https://greensock.com" rel="noreferrer">Green Sock</a> and their JavaScript animation library? We can accomplish so much with it: scrub animations that react to scroll events, all responsive to multiple screen sizes.</p>

    text_content_html: >-
      <p>Speaking of responsive, the site's content and interactions adapt to multiple screen sizes, from extra small devices to large monitors. Oh, and did I mention it is cross-browser compatible?</p>
