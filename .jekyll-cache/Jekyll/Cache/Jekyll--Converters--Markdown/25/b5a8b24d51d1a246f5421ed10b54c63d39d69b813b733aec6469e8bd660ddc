I"π<p>As a co-founder of <a href="https://v7academy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V7 Academy</a>, an online canyoning training course organisation, I was assigned the role to <strong>develop the visual identity and web resources</strong> for the business. The ‚ÄúV7‚Äù in the name represents the hardest, most technical level of an international canyoning rating system, and the website should represent this too. We have worked on a static site with <strong>multiple layouts</strong> to showcase the courses and levels, and linked the Sign-up/Sign-in actions directly with the LearnWorlds platform. The <a href="https://v7academy.com/basecamp">V7 Basecamp blog</a> combines the speed of Jekyll static sites with responsive image generation, and with dedicated, optimized content we have achieved a high-performance and excellent SEO results: <strong>every blog page organically ranks as #1 on Google</strong> for its keyword/keyphrase searches.</p>
