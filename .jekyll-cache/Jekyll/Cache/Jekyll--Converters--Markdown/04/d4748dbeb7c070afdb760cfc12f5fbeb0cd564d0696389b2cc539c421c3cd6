I"¨<p>The <a href="https://somosbogota.tv" target="_blank">Bogot√°</a> team approached me for developing their new website and help represent their new visual identity. Being an agency focused on video animation, illustration and motion graphics, they wanted to add dynamic elements that responded to the user‚Äôs scrolling events. With the design provided by the Bogot√° team, we have polished the site to feature multiple reactive sections leveraging the <a href="https://greensock.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GSAP</a> library. This is only the beginning: as a portfolio website for both Bogot√° and myself, stay tuned for continuous updates and new features‚Ä¶</p>
